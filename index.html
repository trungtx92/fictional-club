                    It makes sense to list the stages of delivery so that the client is able to appreciate the flow of our services. The client
                    is not restricted to the whole service set and can opt out at any stage, thus incurring a cost proportional
                    to services provided.

                    We believe in a hybrid development approach, inspired by Agile development. An agile approach eliminates wasted man hours
                    and useless designs. The iterative nature of the philosophy creates an environment for constant progress.

                        Saras.Care. Saras.Care has been set-up to fight the female feticide problem in various parts of the
                        world. Also, we at SACE design labs have a soft corner for designing mechatronic solutions for human

                        so we are naturally inclined towards designs that we think support and uphold human rights. However,
                        we are not going to deny you your right of having a beautiful and functional design for your future
